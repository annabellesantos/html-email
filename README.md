# HTML Emails

Reflections and screenshots below!

## 3. Testing & Deploying: Reflection

**What adjustments did you make to your email to improve CSS compatibility or general deliverability?**

When running my HTML code in the [HTML Email Check](https://www.htmlemailcheck.com/check/), I followed all of the suggestions to make my code as compatible as possible: adding a meta content tag, converting the copyright symbol to its UTC code, and putting margins on semantic tags.

Viewing multiple test emails also helps with tweaking to improve compatibility. Test emails are invaluable, as I've learned when creating similar emails on Mailchimp and other WYSIWYG/no-code email builders.

\*note on screenshots: I adjusted my code with `max-width` after taking these screenshots, but I already used 2 emails' worth of test emails from Postdrop, so I'll just submit these lol.

## 2. Styling HTML Emails: Reflection

**Describe any tricks or methodologies you developed to complete the task. Alternatively, discuss a trick or tool you found particularly useful in this process.**

I found it helpful to draw a table on the screenshot, to have a rough idea of how many tables, rows and columns are needed for each section. This made laying out the HTML easier, especially when placing tables in tables.

Asking for help is great too!

## 1. Intro to HTML Emails: Reflection

**Why is coding HTML for Email different from web coding?**

Coding for email is different compared to web development because the standards for both environments are different. In the case of emails, the HTML is limited by how it can be styled due to inconsistent CSS capabilities across different email clients.

**What concepts help coders work around the limitations of HTML in Emails?**

Knowing how to design using tables and basic CSS can help coders create emails in HTML.
